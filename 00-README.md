# Setting up your computer for AppAcademy

In order to be successful in the course, your computer needs to be setup in a
very specific way. If the setup is correct, you will not waste your time
fighting the setup of tools and applications, so you can concentrate on the new
material you are learning.

First, head to the guide for your particular operating system. This will give
you an overview of anything in particular you should be aware of for your
system.

From there, you can proceed to the individual sections for installing Google
Chrome, Visual Studio Code, Node.JS, Python, and Docker.

> Important, if you have an Apple Silicon Mac be sure to read the
> [Apple Silicon Mac Addendum] before you start installing software.

> **Prepworkers**: If you are working on the "Online Learning and Challenge Modules"
> course, you do not need to install Node.JS, Python, or Docker to complete the
> assessments. If you are working on the "Beta Solo Prep Work" course, you
> need to install Node.JS, but do not need Python or Docker yet. All prepworkers
> must properly configure Git by following the instructions in [Git Setup].
